# VC-and-BN-for-Chaohu-Flood-Control-System
This repository provides the Vine Copula model developed using R and the Bayesian network model based on Netica 5.18. Used for conducting risk source modeling, stochastic simulation, and risk analysis of the flood control system in the Chaohu Lake Basin.
# Dataset
1.The CDF data of the inflow volume of large reservoirs (LHK, DP, DFY), the lateral inflow volume of the Chaohu Lake(CH), and the highest water level of the external river (YX); CDF of operating water level during flood season and non flood period of large reservoirs; CDF data of operating water level during flood season and non flood period of Chaohu Lake are saved inï¼šVC Data.xlsx
2.The discretization results of the 1000 sets of reservoir lake joint scheduling schemes solved by the scheduling model are saved in:BN.xlsx
3.The engineering parameters of reservoirs and lakes, as well as the data on watershed flood events, are sourced from Water Resources Department of Anhui Province (https://slt.ah.gov.cn), the Anhui Survey & Design Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Co., Ltd. (http://www.asdi.com.cn), and the Chaohu Management Bureau (https://chglj.hefei.gov.cn).
